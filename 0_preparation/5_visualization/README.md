# Preparing for the Summer Institute:  Visualization

## Insert visualization prep material here


## How to install VisIt (software tool) 

* Install VisIt software version 2.12.3 on your computer. Since we will do remote visualization on Comet cluster the correct software version is important. Binaries are recommended (avoid compilation). <https://wci.llnl.gov/simulation/computer-codes/visit/executables>
* Download sample data set for visualization (181 mb) https://wci.llnl.gov/content/assets/docs/simulation/computer-codes/visit/visit_data_files.tar.gz
* Download Comet host file for VisIt at http://users.sdsc.edu/~amit/temp/comet/host_comet_2_12_x.zip
* &#x1F534; Bring a mouse with scroll wheel, as 3D navigation with laptop trackpad is quite onerous

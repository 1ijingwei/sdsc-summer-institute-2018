## Preparing for the Summer Institute

You will get the most out of the SDSC Summer Institute if you come well prepared. By brushing up on your knowledge of Linux and installing all necessary software on your laptop before arriving, you’ll be able to focus your attention on the skills and topics that are most relevant to high performance and data intensive computing.

To help you get the most out of your week, this section containes a set of detailed start-up instructions, beginning with setting up your account and connecting to Comet to configuring your laptop for running visualization software. Please read the documents and exercises carefully, and complete all necessary steps before arriving in San Diego. Feel free to ask questions or if you have any problems with the start-up tasks

###  Computer requirements

* You will need to bring your own laptop for the summer institute. This will be used both for running software locally and connecting to SDSC’s supercomputers.

* For visualization tutorial a mouse with scroll wheel is highly recommended (laptop track pads are very difficult to use for 3D navigation).


### Preparation Activities



### Software requirements

While many of the hands-on activities will be run on Comet, you will also be asked to do some of the exercises on your laptop. Much of the summer institute involves two parallel sessions: a traditional HPC track and a data track. If you plan to participate in the latter, consider installing the following software before you arrive.


#### R (statistical programming language) For Machine Learning Overview

Participants who will be attending the Machine Learning Overview parallel session on Thursday will need to install R (https://www.r-project.org/) and RStudio Desktop open source edition (https://www.rstudio.com/) on their laptops. A basic understanding of R will be very helpful and we recommend the following resources:

* https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html


#### VisIt (software tool) for Visualization

* Install VisIt software version 2.12.3 on your computer. Since we will do remote visualization on Comet cluster the correct software version is important. Binaries are recommended (avoid compilation). <https://wci.llnl.gov/simulation/computer-codes/visit/executables>
* Download sample data set for visualization (181 mb) https://wci.llnl.gov/content/assets/docs/simulation/computer-codes/visit/visit_data_files.tar.gz
* Download Comet host file for VisIt at http://users.sdsc.edu/~amit/temp/comet/host_comet_2_12_x.zip
* &#x1F534; Bring a mouse with scroll wheel, as 3D navigation with laptop trackpad is quite onerous

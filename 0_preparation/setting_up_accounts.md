## Preparing for the Summer Institute:  Class accounts

We are asking all attendees to use the training accounts that we will be providing, even if you already have your own account. This will minimize problems related to custom configurations (e.g. environment variables, choice of shell, etc.) that may cause some of the hands-on examples to break and gives participants access to the Comet reservation created for the workshop.

You should have been given your account information by Institute staff. If you do not have a class account, please contact us at [INSERT EMAIL CONTENT HERE].


### Connecting to Comet (or other SDSC HPC systems):

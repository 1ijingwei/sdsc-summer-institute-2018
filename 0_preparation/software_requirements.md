## Preparing for the Summer Institute: Software Requirements

While many of the hands-on activities will be run on Comet, you will also be asked to do some of the exercises on your laptop. Much of the summer institute involves a few sessions that require customized software to be installed on your laptop. Please instal the following software before you arrive. Note: several of the preparation activities will provide information and guidance on how to install the required software components.

##  Secure Shell (SSH)

insert somethign about this (if needed)

## R (statistical programming language) For Machine Learning Overview

Participants who will be attending the Machine Learning Overview parallel session on Thursday will need to install R (https://www.r-project.org/) and RStudio Desktop open source edition (https://www.rstudio.com/) on their laptops. A basic understanding of R will be very helpful and we recommend the following resources:

* https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html


### VisIt (software tool) for Visualization

* Install VisIt software version 2.12.3 on your computer. Since we will do remote visualization on Comet cluster the correct software version is important. Binaries are recommended (avoid compilation). <https://wci.llnl.gov/simulation/computer-codes/visit/executables>
* Download sample data set for visualization (181 mb) https://wci.llnl.gov/content/assets/docs/simulation/computer-codes/visit/visit_data_files.tar.gz
* Download Comet host file for VisIt at http://users.sdsc.edu/~amit/temp/comet/host_comet_2_12_x.zip
* &#x1F534; Bring a mouse with scroll wheel, as 3D navigation with laptop trackpad is quite onerous

# Preparing for the SDSC Summer Institute

## Obtaining your class account:

We are asking all attendees to use the training accounts that we will be providing, even if you already have your own account. This will minimize problems related to custom configurations (e.g. environment variables, choice of shell, etc.) that may cause some of the hands-on examples to break and gives participants access to the Comet reservation created for the workshop.

### Notes: 
* You should have gotten email for the Institute staff welcoming you to the Institute, with instructions about how to obtain your account information. If you did not recieve these instructions, please contact us at [INSERT EMAIL CONTENT HERE].
* You should have been given your account information ( `<username>`  and `<password>` by Institute staff. If you do not have a class account, please contact us at [INSERT EMAIL CONTENT HERE].

### Getting Domain Name & Host Information
Each machine you work with will have a `<hostname>` or `<ip address>`. These are explained below.
* NOTE: The *DN* (domain name) for Comet is    `comet.sdsc.edu`

You may need to know the physical IP address of the cluster. To do this, run the `nslookup` command from the command line of a terminal window
```
[username@comet:] nslookup comet.sdsc.edu
Server:		192.168.86.1
Address:	192.168.86.1#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:	comet.sdsc.edu
Address: 198.202.113.253
Name:	comet.sdsc.edu
Address: 198.202.113.252
```

## Connecting to Comet (or other SDSC HPC systems):

You will be using your laptop to access SDSCâ€™s HPC systems using the secure shell command `ssh`. It is essential that you be able to run secure shell (or a similar connection tool) with X11 forwarding enabled, which allows you to have data encryption and to launch windows applications (e.g. plotting, or a browser). 

* For Mac users, the Terminal application is typically used for connections. This is done from the command line:

    ssh -X username@hostname
    
 If you are having trouble, try running `ssh` in verbose mode:
 
     ssh -v -X username@hostname

* Windows users will need to run an X Server and an ssh-like client. [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com) provides a comprehensive Linux-like environment and an X server (Cygwin/X)

## Connecting to Comet (or other SDSC HPC systems):

In this exercise, you will use your class training account to log onto the Comet cluster. This exercise verifies that your account is working, and that your laptop is properly configured.

You should have been given your [user account](https://github.com/sdsc/sdsc-summer-institute-2018/blob/master/0_preparation/1_setting_up_accounts.md) information via email, by Institute staff. 

If you do not have a class account, or if you have _any_ difficulties completeing this task, please contact Institute staff at [EMAIL HERE]. If you forgot your password, please visit [PASSWORD RESET PAGE] to recover it.

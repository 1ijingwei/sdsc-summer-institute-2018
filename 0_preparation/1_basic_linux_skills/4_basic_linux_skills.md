## Preparing for the Summer Institute:  Basic Linux Skills

Here we will put the basic skills students need to learn


Please remember that basic Linux skills are necessary to complete the hands-on exercises. If it’s been a while since you’ve worked in a Linux environment, be sure to reacquaint yourself with the following topics: copying, listing, deleting and renaming files; using wildcards; navigating directories; changing file permissions; setting environment variables; using common utilities (grep, cat, less, head, sort, tar, gzip). A nice tutorial can be found here http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/. You should also be comfortable with one of the standard Linux editors, such as vim, emacs, or nano.

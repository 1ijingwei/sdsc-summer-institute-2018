## Using Virtualization on Comet - _Singularity_ Containers or _Comet_ Virtual Cluster

Two mechanisms can be use to execute code not typically provided in the standard
 _Comet_ application stack.

Those mechanisms are:

- Containerized applications with Singularity
- Virtualized environments with _Comet_ Virtual Clusters

This tutorial will briefly describe _Comet_ Virtual Cluster capabilities and
focus primarily on using Singularity containers on _Comet_.

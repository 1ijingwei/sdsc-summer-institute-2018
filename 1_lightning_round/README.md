## Lighting rounds

Wednesday afternoon of the Summer Institute, we will be holding a Lightning Round. This is a
longstanding tradition where all participants are asked to present two slides describing (1) their
work or research and (2) their computational challenges and what they hope to accomplish
from attending the Summer Institute.

Feel free to alter the slides in any way you see fit using your choice of figures, text, fonts, etc.
We just ask that you limit yourself to two slides and make sure that your name and institution
appear on both slides. Each participant will be limited to four minutes, so please consider
rehearsing before the Lightning Round. Finally, keep in mind that the Summer Institute
participants come from many different backgrounds, so tailor your content for non-specialists.

### Create the slides

Download the slides template above, edit it with Powerpoint or Google Docs and then
export it to PDF and name it `lastname.pdf` with your last name, all lowercase.

### Upload the slides

* Login to Github
* Inside the current `1_lightning_round` folder click on the "Upload files" button on the top-right
* Drag or upload `lastname.pdf` 
* Click on "Propose file change"
* Click on "Create Pull Request" 2 times until the pull request is finalized

We will concatenate all the slides into a single deck in alphabetic order on Wednesday at noon.
